      title: "Cricket Shot Intent Inference",
      image: CricketShotPic,
      description: "Developed a system to quantify a batsman's energy by analyzing body movements during shot execution. Used Google ML Kit to process 33 body joints, applied Fourier transformation, acceleration, and angle analysis for improved accuracy. Created comprehensive CSV datasets for machine learning training and testing, enhancing shot classification. Future applications include helping coaches understand a batsmanâ€™s intent against specific bowlers in different match scenarios.",
